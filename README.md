# Spotify-Listening-History
The end of the year Spotify Wrapped doesn't return your all time listening history data... So I coded a script that could let me see my listening stats.

# Notes
- The spotify_all_time_history.csv is my script's output file. This shows a list of the my songs ordered by listening time (greatest to least)
